<blockquote>
  <p>I am not sure if you actually need this list but mathematics is everywhere and itâ€™s better to know these notaions. Spacially if you are pursuing higher education or you really want to understand the world you live in. Recently I have started doing mathematics for my Masterâ€™s degree and I was having problems remembering some basic mathematical notaions. Which is really bad! So I decided to make a list of some usefull and basic mathematical notaions. I gathered the information mostly from Wikipedia and Quora. I will keep updating the list.</p>
