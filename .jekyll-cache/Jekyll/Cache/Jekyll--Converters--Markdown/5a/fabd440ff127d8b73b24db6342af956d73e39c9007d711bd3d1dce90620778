<p>Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating cloud file storage. It is basically a free and open source version of google drive. It offers some really nice features. After Google announced that Google Photos will no longer allow unlimited photo storage at high-quality from June 1, 2021, I decided to give Nextcloud a try. Here I will be sharing my experience on how I built my own personal cloud storage with Nextcloud and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.</p>
