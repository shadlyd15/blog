        I am  Shadly Salahuddin, born and raised in the old city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have completed my 
        Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering 
        & Technology (RUET), Bangladesh. Recognizing my passion for computer science, I enrolled myself into 
        Bergische Universität Wuppertal for a Master's Degree in Coumputer Simulation in Science. Currently I 
        am living in Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

        In March 2016, after completing my bachelor’s degree, I started my career as an Embedded System 
        Engineer in AplombTech BD Limited (A concern of Sinepulse GmbH, Germany). My job responsibility was 
        to design and develop firmware and software services for IoT and Industry 4.0 devices. During
        my tenure here, I have also developed some Linux based operating systems using openwrt and 
        buildroot for different embedded linux projects. It is a great pride of mine that my designed 
        and developed IoT devices are deployed and running successfully in different corners of Bangladesh.

        After working as an Embedded System Engineer for 3 years, I did quit my job to try and learn something new. 
        I started working as a Software Engineer in, PeepThePlace, a company in Bangladesh focused on surveillance 
        systems. There I worked on their backend systems with technologies like Javascript, Node.js, AWS, GraphQL etc. 
        As I had prior experiences with Embedded Linux, I started developing OpenWrt based operating systems for our 
        company's servilance system. I ended up my journey with this company just after 5 months of joinijng to 
        take a leap of faith.

        Globalization has broken the borders between countries and paved a way to pursue one’s passion even 
        in a distant land. Soon I realized thatn it is imperative to engage in a more competitive and progressive 
        learning. So Investing 100% of myself, I took the leap of faith. In October 2019, I started a new chapter 
        of my life in Germany as a Master's student in Bergische Universität Wuppertal.
